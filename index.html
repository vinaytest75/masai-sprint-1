            <div class="Ind21">A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device. Since the 1980s, video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry, and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute.

            The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms. Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others. Specialized platforms such as arcade game were common in the 1980s in video arcades. These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles, as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop, desktop or handheld computing devices.
